Agents are software entities that act on behalf of users or other software systems, and having knowledge of how they function can help in building more efficient and effective systems. Tools are essential for developing and implementing natural language processing algorithms, and being familiar with the various tools available can streamline the development process. Vector search databases are used for storing and retrieving high-dimensional data, and understanding how they work can help in designing better search and recommendation systems.\\n\\nOverall, having knowledge of Agents, Tools, and Vector Search DB with langchain can significantly enhance one's skills in natural language processing and data retrieval, and can open up a wide range of opportunities in fields such as artificial intelligence, data science, and information retrieval.\""

              "'Page: LangChain\\nSummary: LangChain is a software framework that helps facilitate the integration of large language models (LLMs) into applications. As a language model integration framework, LangChain\\'s use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\\n\\nPage: Vector database\\nSummary: A vector database, vector store or vector search engine is a database that uses the vector space model to store vectors (fixed-length lists of numbers) along with other data items. Vector databases typically implement one or more approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, so that one can search the database with a query vector to retrieve the closest matching database records.\\nVectors are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data, with the number of dimensions ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands, depending on the complexity of the data being represented. A vector\\'s position in this space represents its characteristics. Words, phrases, or entire documents, as well as images, audio, and other types of data, can all be vectorized.\\nThese feature vectors may be computed from the raw data using machine learning methods such as feature extraction algorithms, word embeddings or deep learning networks. The goal is that semantically similar data items receive feature vectors close to each other.\\nVector databases can be used for similarity search, semantic search, multi-modal search, recommendations engines, large language models (LLMs), object detection,  etc.\\nVector databases are also often used to implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a method to improve domain-specific responses of large language models. The retrieval component of a RAG can be any search system, but is most often implemented as a vector database. Text documents describing the domain of interest are collected, and for each document or document section, a feature vector (known as an \"embedding\") is computed, typically using a deep learning network, and stored in a vector database. Given a user prompt, the feature vector of the prompt is computed, and the database is queried to retrieve the most relevant documents. These are then automatically added into the context window of the large language model, and the large language model proceeds to create a response to the prompt given this context.\\n\\nPage: Retrieval-augmented generation\\nSummary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to retrieve and incorporate new information. With RAG, LLMs do not respond to user queries until they refer to a specified set of documents. These documents supplement information from the LLM\\'s pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information that is not available in the training data. For example, this helps LLM-based chatbots access internal company data or generate responses based on authoritative sources.\\nRAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have caused chatbots to describe policies that don\\'t exist, or recommend nonexistent legal cases to lawyers that are looking for citations to support their arguments.\\nRAG also reduces the need to retrain LLMs with new data, saving on computational and financial costs. Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include sources in their responses, so users can verify the cited sources. This provides greater transparency, as us'"

            "Summary: The prime minister of the United Kingdom is the head of government of the United Kingdom. The prime minister advises the sovereign on the exercise of much of the royal prerogative, chairs the Cabinet, and selects its ministers. Modern prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, so they are invariably members of Parliament.\n",
            "The office of prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document, but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons. In practice, this is the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in the Commons. The prime minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury (prior to 1905 also the official title of the position), Minister for the Civil Service, the minister responsible for national security, and Minister for the Union. The prime minister's official residence and office is 10 Downing Street in London.\n",
            "Early conceptions of the office of prime minister evolved as the primus inter pares (\"first among equals\"); however that does not differentiate on status and responsibility upon whoever is holding office. Historically, the prime minister has never been the first among equals at any time prior to 1868. Until now, that characterisation of the prime minister is reflective of the democratic nature of their position. The power of the prime minister depends on the support of their respective party and on the popular mandate. The appointment of cabinet ministers and granting of honours are done through the prime minister's power of appointment. The prime minister alongside the cabinet proposes new legislation and decides on key policies that fit their agenda which are then passed by an act of parliament.\n",
            "The power of the office of prime minister has grown significantly since the first prime minister, Robert Walpole in 1721. Prime ministerial power evolved gradually alongside the office itself which have played an increasingly prominent role in British politics since the early 20th century. During the premierships of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, prime ministerial power expanded substantially, and their leaderships in the office were described as \"presidential\" due to their personal wielding of power and tight control over the cabinet. The prime minister is one of the world's most powerful political leaders in modern times. As the leader of the world's sixth largest economy, the prime minister holds significant domestic and international leadership, being the leader of a prominent member state of NATO, the G7 and G20.\n",
            "As of 2025 58 people (55 men and 3 women) have served as prime minister, the first of whom was Robert Walpole taking office on 3 April 1721. The longest-serving prime minister was also Walpole, who served over 20 years, and the shortest-serving was Liz Truss, who served seven weeks. Keir Starmer succeeded Rishi Sunak as prime minister on 5 July 2024, following the 2024 general election.\n",

            "Page: List of prime ministers of the United Kingdom\n",
            "Summary: The prime minister of the United Kingdom is the principal minister of the crown of His Majesty's Government, and the head of the British Cabinet. \n",
            "There is no specific date for when the office of prime minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over time through a merger of duties. The term was regularly, if informally, used by Robert Walpole by the 1730s. It was used in the House of Commons as early as 1805, and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s, although did not become the official title until 1905, when Henry Campbell-Bannerman was prime minister.  \n",
            "Historians generally consider Robert Walpole, who led the government of the Kingdom of Great Britain for over twenty years from 1721, to be the first prime minister. Walpole is al\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI now have the final answer.\n",

A contemporary retelling of the legendary Arabic tragedy Layla and Majnun, it follows two star-crossed lovers, Laila (Dimri) and Qais Bhatt (Tiwary) who are unable to unite as they face opposition from their families. However, when fate intervenes, Laila marries another man while Qais goes to London. They reunite after four years, but end up waiting more for each other.\n",

It is based on the story of the ancient Arabic legend \"Layla and Majnun\" about the unhappy love of the young man Qays, nicknamed \"Majnun\" (\"The Madman\"), towards beautiful Layla.

            "Summary: The prime minister of the United Kingdom is the head of government of the United Kingdom. The prime minister advises the sovereign on the exercise of much of the royal prerogative, chairs the Cabinet, and selects its ministers. Modern prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, so they are invariably members of Parliament.\n",
            "The office of prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document, but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons. In practice, this is the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in the Commons. The prime minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury (prior to 1905 also the official title of the position), Minister for the Civil Service, the minister responsible for national security, and Minister for the Union. The prime minister's official residence and office is 10 Downing Street in London.\n",
            "Early conceptions of the office of prime minister evolved as the primus inter pares (\"first among equals\"); however that does not differentiate on status and responsibility upon whoever is holding office. Historically, the prime minister has never been the first among equals at any time prior to 1868. Until now, that characterisation of the prime minister is reflective of the democratic nature of their position. The power of the prime minister depends on the support of their respective party and on the popular mandate. The appointment of cabinet ministers and granting of honours are done through the prime minister's power of appointment. The prime minister alongside the cabinet proposes new legislation and decides on key policies that fit their agenda which are then passed by an act of parliament.\n",
            "The power of the office of prime minister has grown significantly since the first prime minister, Robert Walpole in 1721. Prime ministerial power evolved gradually alongside the office itself which have played an increasingly prominent role in British politics since the early 20th century. During the premierships of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, prime ministerial power expanded substantially, and their leaderships in the office were described as \"presidential\" due to their personal wielding of power and tight control over the cabinet. The prime minister is one of the world's most powerful political leaders in modern times. As the leader of the world's sixth largest economy, the prime minister holds significant domestic and international leadership, being the leader of a prominent member state of NATO, the G7 and G20.\n",
            "As of 2025 58 people (55 men and 3 women) have served as prime minister, the first of whom was Robert Walpole taking office on 3 April 1721. The longest-serving prime minister was also Walpole, who served over 20 years, and the shortest-serving was Liz Truss, who served seven weeks. Keir Starmer succeeded Rishi Sunak as prime minister on 5 July 2024, following the 2024 general election.\n",

            "There is no specific date for when the office of prime minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over time through a merger of duties. The term was regularly, if informally, used by Robert Walpole by the 1730s. It was used in the House of Commons as early as 1805, and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s, although did not become the official title until 1905, when Henry Campbell-Bannerman was prime minister.  \n",

            "Summary: During his second presidency, Donald Trump, president of the United States, triggered a global trade war after he enacted a series of steep tariffs affecting nearly all goods imported into the country. From January to April 2025, the average applied US tariff rate rose from 2.5% to an estimated 27%—the highest level in over a century. After changes and negotiations, the rate was estimated at 18.6% as of August 2025. By July 2025, tariffs represented 5% of federal revenue compared to 2% historically.\n",
            "Under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, Trump raised steel, aluminum, and copper tariffs to 50% and introduced a 25% tariff on imported cars from most countries. New tariffs on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and other sectors are under consideration.\n",
            "Trump also claimed unprecedented tariff authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). On April 2, 2025, he invoked the law to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on imports from all countries not subject to other sanctions. A universal 10% tariff took effect on April 5. Although plans for additional country-specific \"reciprocal tariffs\" were delayed in the wake of the 2025 stock market crash, they were ultimately implemented on August 7. The de minimis exemption was eliminated effective August 29, 2025 under the IEEPA; previously, packages valued below $800 were exempt from tariffs. Sweeping use of the IEEPA sparked a trade war with Canada and Mexico and escalated the China–United States trade war.\n",
            "Federal courts have ruled that the tariffs imposed under the IEEPA are illegal; however, they remain in effect while the case is appealed. In V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, the Court of Appeals allowed the IEEPA tariffs to stand until at least October 14, 2025, to give the government time to seek review by the Supreme Court. The rulings do not affect tariffs imposed under Section 232 or Section 301.\n",
            "The Trump administration argues that its tariffs will promote domestic manufacturing, protect national security, and substitute for income taxes. The administration views trade deficits as inherently harmful, a stance economists criticized as a flawed understanding of trade. Although Trump has said foreign countries pay his tariffs, US tariffs are fees paid by businesses that import foreign goods, which are then often passed on to US consumers. The tariffs contributed to downgraded GDP growth projections by the Federal Reserve, the OECD, and the World Bank.\n",

            "Summary: Donald Trump's second and current tenure as the president of the United States began upon his inauguration as the 47th president on January 20, 2025. Trump, a member of the Republican Party who previously served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021, took office after defeating the vice president, Kamala Harris of the Democratic Party, in the 2024 presidential election. \n",
            "The first few months of his presidency consisted of issuing multiple executive orders, many of which are being challenged in court. On immigration, he signed the Laken Riley Act into law, and issued executive orders blocking illegal immigrants from entering the U.S., reinstating the national emergency at the Mexico–U.S. border, designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations, attempting to end birthright citizenship, and initiating procedures for mass deportation of immigrants. Trump established a task force known as the Department of Government Efficiency, which is tasked with reducing spending by the federal government and limiting bureaucracy, and which has overseen mass layoffs of civil servants. The Trump administration has taken action against law firms for challenging Trump's executive orders and policies. Trump has overseen a series of tariff increases and pauses, which has led to retaliatory tariffs placed on the U.S. by other countries. These tariff moves, particularly the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, and counter-mo\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe information provided by Wikipedia is extensive and detailed, providing insights into the current scenario of Trump's tariffs on various goods.

His tribe Banu 'Amir, and the community gave him the epithet of Majnūn (مجنون \"crazy\", lit. \"possessed by Jinn\"). Long before Nizami, the legend circulated in anecdotal forms in Iranian akhbar. The early anecdotes and oral reports about Majnun are documented in Kitab al-Aghani and Ibn Qutaybah's Al-Shi'r wa-l-Shu'ara'. The anecdotes are mostly very short, only loosely connected, and show little or no plot development. Nizami collected both secular and mystical sources about Majnun and portrayed a vivid picture of the famous lovers. Subsequently, many other Persian poets imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. Nizami drew influence from Udhrite (Udhri) love poetry, which is characterized by erotic abandon and attraction to the beloved, often by means of an unfulfillable longing.\n",
            "Many imitations have been contrived of Nizami's work, several of which are original literary works in their own right, including Amir Khusrow Dehlavi's Majnun o Leyli (completed in 1299), and Jami's version, completed in 1484, amounting to 3,860 couplets. Other notable reworkings are by Maktabi Shirazi, Hatefi (died 1520), and Fuzuli (died 1556), which became popular in Ottoman Turkey and India. Sir William Jones published Hatefi's romance in Calcutta in 1788. The popularity of the romance following Nizami's version is also evident from the references to it in lyrical poetry and mystical masnavis—before the appearance of Nizami's romance, there are just some allusions to Layla and Majnun in divans. The number and variety of anecdotes about the lovers also increased considerably from the twelfth century onwards. Mystics contrived many stories about Majnun to illustrate technical mystical concepts such as fanaa (annihilation), divānagi (love-madness), self-sacrifice, etc. Nizami's work has been translated into many languages. The modern Arabic-language adaptation of the classical Arabic story include Shawqi's play The Mad Lover of Layla.\n",

However, when fate intervenes, Laila marries another man while Qais goes to London. They reunite after four years, but end up waiting more for each other.\n",
